# ADR-0005: Database architecture

Status: Accepted

Date: 2026-10-05

Owner: Repository owner; named delegate unassigned.

## Context

The owner is building an enterprise architecture standards repository consumed by application developers and coding agents. Frontend and backend applications must remain independent. Domain boundaries need usable, verifiable guidance.

## Decision

Maintain database architecture as a first-class domain with logical and physical views.

## Alternatives

Keep informal guidance in conversation: rejected because it cannot be pinned or checked. Combine all domains into one document: rejected because ownership and applicability become unclear. Use domain documents linked through a solution baseline: selected for reviewable boundaries.

## Consequences

Each domain can evolve independently but changes require cross-domain review. Teams must maintain solution traceability and verification. More documentation is justified only when it changes design or operations.

## Traceability

See [Database architecture](../database/architecture.md), [principles](../ARCHITECTURE-PRINCIPLES.md), and [adoption](../governance/adoption.md). Related: [ADR-0010](0010-independent-applications.md), [ADR-0011](0011-agent-consumption.md).

## Verification

Ownership register review; Migration rehearsal and mixed-version integration tests; Constraint tests and query plan review; Grant inspection; Recovery exercise review.

## Approval

Owner explicitly requested this documentation domain in the supplied conversation. Acceptance covers the domain’s existence and scope; detailed implementation rules remain a draft baseline until adopted.
